# Polyrise-fork is a fork of polyrise
## Polyrise is originally by michaelsboost
## History
to experiment with polyrise, I created a fork of it.
I used it to make the old version of pythone.github.io, which might be used again [which is now at this site](https://pythone.github.io/old_pythone.github.io/)
